Here we are discussing the future scope of the project and hence figure out ways in which the model can be improved when it is being taken up and implemented by 
companies that have the potential to work on it.

(A) Tackling the famous problem of crowd management during an emergency when passing through an exit gate that scans RFID tags, we propose the parallel detection 
problem with the solutiong of adding a detector bag which is automatically able to scan items when they are put inside the bag and remove them from the itenary when 
it is removed from the bag.

(B) When concerend with the product success rate, we want to make sure that after an item is selected by the customer, it makes past the billing. If not, we try to 
evaluate why this is happening and on what frequency this occurs so as to figure out the problem with that particular item or the category or the brand as a whole.
